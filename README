Introduction:
This is a python program that on input an original adjacency matrix, will output the skeleton matrix of it.

The procedure to find skeleton matrix is as follows:
adjacency matrix (A) -> reachable matrix (M):
M=(A+I)^k s.t. (A+I)^k = (A+I)^(k+1)
reachable matrix (M) -> skeleton matrix (T):
1. removing equivalent nodes
2. calculating all independent parts
3. ordering nodes in each independent part

Input Format:
An integer N: number of row and columns of the adjacency matrix
N*N integers: representing the adjacency matrix

Output Format:
K (<=N) integers: representing the rows and columns in the original adjacency matrix each row and column represents in the skeleton matrix
K*K integers: representing the skeleton matrix.
